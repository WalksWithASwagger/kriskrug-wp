## Core Beliefs

### Grassroots > Top-Down

**We believe:**
- Communities know what they need better than institutions
- Bottom-up movements create lasting change
- Diverse participation leads to better outcomes
- Local context matters immensely

**For kk.ca this means:**
- Features that enable local organizing
- Tools for community members to contribute
- Platforms for diverse voices
- Regional customization and flexibility

### Inclusive by Design, Not as Afterthought

**We believe:**
- Accessibility from day one, not retrofit
- Inclusion requires intentional design
- Barriers are often invisible to those without them
- Technology should unite, not divide

**For kk.ca this means:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA is baseline, not aspiration
- Mobile-first because that's how many people access web
- Simple language welcomes everyone
- Multiple participation modes (events, online, resources)

### Responsible AI Requires Accountability

**We believe:**
- AI should be explainable and transparent
- Privacy is a right, not a privilege
- Communities should control their data
- Technology should empower, not extract

**For kk.ca this means:**
- Clear about what data we collect and why
- No tracking without consent
- Open about our own AI usage
- Ethical automation (agents documented and auditable)

## Guiding Principles for Development

### When Choosing Features

**Ask:**
1. Does this serve the community?
2. Is it accessible and inclusive?
3. Does it align with responsible AI?

5. Is it the simplest solution?

**If yes to all → build it.**
**If no to any → reconsider or redesign.**

### When Making Trade-offs

**Prioritize:**
1. Mission alignment > technical coolness
2. Community needs > individual wants
3. Accessibility > features
4. Sustainability > rapid growth
5. Quality > quantity

### When Facing Constraints

**Remember:**
- Constraints breed creativity
- Simplicity is a strength
- Community can help
- Long-term thinking wins
