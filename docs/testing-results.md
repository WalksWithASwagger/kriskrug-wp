gh extension list | grep sherpa
# Result: ✓ gh sherpa InditexTech/gh-sherpa 1.5.0
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS
- Extension installed correctly
- Version 1.5.0 confirmed

### gh-fzf Extension
**Test:** Verified installation

```bash
gh extension list | grep fzf
# Result: ✓ gh fzf benelan/gh-fzf d4c50241
```

**Outcome:** ✅ PASS
- Extension installed correctly
- Ready for interactive fuzzy finding

## 🔧 What We Learned

### 1. Label Management
**Issue:** Labels must exist before batch issue creation can use them

**Solution:**
- Use standard labels (bug, enhancement, etc.) OR
- Create labels first with `gh label create` OR
- Create issues without labels and let auto-triage add them

**Recommendation:** Let auto-triage workflow handle labeling - it's more intelligent anyway!

### 2. Workflow Triggers
**Success:** GitHub Actions workflows trigger immediately on issue creation

**Observations:**
- Auto-triage completed in 15 seconds
- Sync Projects completed in 8 seconds
- Both workflows ran in parallel
- No permission issues encountered

### 3. Agent State Structure
**Success:** State management system is well-designed and flexible

**Strengths:**
- JSON format is human-readable and git-friendly
- Stage-based tracking allows resume from failures
- Retry counters prevent infinite loops
- Metadata field allows custom extensions

## 📝 Recommendations for Next Steps

### Option 1: Mock WordPress Environment
Create minimal PHP files to test:
- PHPCS validation scripts
- WordPress coding standards checking
- Basic PHPUnit test execution

### Option 2: Test with Real Issues
Use the 7 existing issues from website audit:
- They're real, well-defined problems
- Good candidates for testing agent analysis
- Can simulate agent outputs manually

### Option 3: Integrate gh agent-task
Configure and test:
- Update agent-pr-generator.yml
- Add orchestration logic
- Test with simple mock issue

### Option 4: Full WordPress Setup
Set up local WordPress for complete testing:
- Install WordPress locally
- Create test plugin
- Run full agent pipeline

All core components work as designed:
- ✅ Scripts execute correctly
- ✅ Workflows trigger and complete
- ✅ State management functions
