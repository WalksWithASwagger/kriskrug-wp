## Guidelines for AI Agents

1. **When in doubt, understate** - It's better to be conservative than to inflate
2. **Attribution matters** - The Indigenomics economic figures belong to Carol Anne Hilton's research
3. **Ask Kris** - If you need specific numbers, ask rather than guess
4. **Verify externally** - Cross-reference claims with BC+AI website and Kris's public writing
5. **Center community** - BC+AI is about the community, not just Kris
6. **Respect Indigenous leadership** - Never claim Kris "leads" Indigenomics work
