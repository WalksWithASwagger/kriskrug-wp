# About Kris Krüg

## Bridging Art, AI, Indigenous Wisdom, and Justice

My name is Kris Krüg—a boundary-pushing creative explorer, intuitive tech whisperer, and culture hacker. But today, I'm so much more.

## What I Do Now

### Executive Director, BC+AI

I lead BC+AI, a grassroots movement of **2,000+ members** building a responsible and inclusive AI future for British Columbia.

What started as monthly meetups in Vancouver with 80 people has grown into a province-wide community—proving that another tech future is possible. One built on ethics, creativity, and genuine community power, not extraction.

**Vancouver AI Community:** 250+ monthly attendees
**Policy Influence:** Advising BC government on AI governance
**Mission:** Proving communities, not corporations, should shape AI's future

### CTO, Indigenomics.ai

As Chief Technology Officer of Indigenomics.ai, I work at the intersection of Indigenous wisdom and emerging technology, building platforms that serve Indigenous economic sovereignty.

Through the Indigenomics framework—grounded in Carol Anne Hilton's vision of Economy as Ceremony—we've discovered over **$200 billion** in previously unaccounted Indigenous economic activity across Canada.

This isn't about extracting from Indigenous communities. It's about building technology that honors Indigenous data sovereignty, respects protocols, and serves Nation-building on Indigenous terms.

**Technology without wisdom is just destruction.** Indigenomics proves we can build tech that serves justice.

### Co-founder, The Upgrade AI

With Peter Bittner, I co-founded The Upgrade AI to democratize access to AI tools and training.

We train **Fortune 500 companies** AND independent artists, proving that powerful AI doesn't have to be locked behind expensive consultants or technical gatekeepers.

Our philosophy: **Collaborate with AI, don't just use it.** Maintain human agency while amplifying creativity. Build with responsibility, not recklessness.

The Upgrade AI makes cutting-edge AI accessible to those who need it most—the creators, storytellers, and community builders shaping our collective future.

## My Mission (Still True)

In the fabric of the digital era, where technology often overshadows humanity, I've taken it upon myself to chart a different course.

**I'm on a relentless mission to humanize technology**—to infuse it with empathy, ethics, and emotion.

I'm not just tinkering with gadgets and algorithms; I'm reprogramming the very core of our interactions with the digital world to resonate with the heartbeat of human experience.

I challenge indifference with passion, confront disconnection with engagement, and replace passive consumption with active creation.

**I stand firm in the belief that art shouldn't be a rarefied luxury, but a common language for all.** By democratizing art and technology, I aim to unlock universal creative potential.

## Photography: Where It All Began

My journey started behind the camera—capturing the world for National Geographic, Rolling Stone, and documenting everyone from tech pioneers (Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg) to cultural icons.

**Visual storytelling taught me** how to see connections others miss. How to document humanity. How to bridge worlds that seem separate.

That photographer's eye—the ability to frame complex narratives, find the human story, capture the moment that matters—now informs everything I do in AI, community building, and Indigenous tech work.

Photography isn't my primary focus anymore. But it's the foundation that shapes how I approach technology, community, and justice.

## My Values

**Indigenous Sovereignty First**
I work on the unceded territories of the Coast Salish, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh peoples. Indigenous wisdom and sovereignty aren't add-ons to my work—they're foundational.

**Community Over Extraction**
Technology should serve communities, not extract from them. Every project I build asks: Who benefits? Who's centered? Who has power?

**Bridge-Building**
Art + Technology. Indigenous wisdom + AI. Academia + Grassroots. Policy + Practice. The most interesting innovation happens at intersections.

**Technology + Wisdom**
Without wisdom, technology is just destruction. With wisdom, it can serve collective liberation.
