```
BC+AI: Building a Responsible AI Ecosystem
```

### Content
```
As Executive Director of BC+AI, I lead a grassroots movement of 2,000+ members
building a responsible and inclusive AI future for British Columbia.

What started as monthly meetups in Vancouver with 80 people has grown into a
province-wide community of AI professionals, policy makers, artists, educators,
and activists—all united by a commitment to AI that serves communities, not
extraction.

Key Achievements:
• Grew Vancouver AI Community from 80 to 250+ monthly attendees
• Built 2,000+ member network across BC
• Advise BC government on AI policy and governance
• Foster collaboration between Indigenous leaders, academics, and technologists
• Created framework for community-led AI development

BC+AI proves another tech future is possible—one built on ethics, creativity,
and genuine community power.

## Issue #14: Indigenomics.ai CTO Section

### Section Title
```
Indigenomics: Technology for Indigenous Sovereignty
```

### Content
```
As CTO of Indigenomics.ai, I work at the intersection of Indigenous wisdom and
emerging technology, building platforms that serve Indigenous economic
sovereignty and self-determination.

Through the Indigenomics framework—grounded in Carol Anne Hilton's vision of
Economy as Ceremony—we've discovered over $200 billion in previously
unaccounted Indigenous economic activity across Canada.

This isn't about extracting from Indigenous communities. It's about building
technology that honors Indigenous data sovereignty, respects protocols, and
serves Nation-building on Indigenous terms.

Key Focus Areas:
• Indigenous AI sovereignty and design principles
• Economic discovery and measurement
• Technology respecting Indigenous protocols
• Building capacity for Indigenous-led tech innovation
• Capital realignment toward Indigenous futures

Technology without wisdom is just destruction. Indigenomics proves we can build
tech that serves justice, not just profit.

## Issue #15: The Upgrade AI Section

### Section Title
```
The Upgrade AI: Democratizing AI for Everyone
```

### Content
```
As Co-founder of The Upgrade AI (with Peter Bittner), I'm helping organizations
and creative professionals navigate the AI age with confidence and ethics.

We train Fortune 500 companies AND independent artists, proving that powerful
AI tools don't have to be locked behind expensive consultants or technical
gatekeepers. Everyone deserves to understand and leverage AI—especially those
creating culture and building communities.

Our approach: Collaborate with AI, don't just use it. Maintain human agency
while amplifying creativity. Build with responsibility, not recklessness.

What We Do:
• AI strategy and implementation workshops
• Training for media, PR, and creative professionals
• Custom programs for organizations and teams
• Hands-on prompt engineering and tool mastery
• Responsible AI governance frameworks

The Upgrade AI makes cutting-edge AI accessible to those who need it most—the
creators, storytellers, and community builders shaping our collective future.
