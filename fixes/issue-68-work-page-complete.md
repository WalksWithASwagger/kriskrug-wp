## 🪶 Indigenomics: Technology for Sovereignty

### Chief Technology Officer

**What It Is:**
Building technology that serves Indigenous economic sovereignty and self-determination, grounded in Carol Anne Hilton's vision of "Economy as Ceremony."

**The Discovery:**
Through the Indigenomics framework, we've identified over **$200 billion** in previously unaccounted Indigenous economic activity across Canada—revealing the invisible economy that sustains Indigenous peoples and Nations.

**How Technology Serves:**
- **Data Sovereignty:** Indigenous communities control their own data and narratives
- **Protocol-Respecting:** Technology built with Indigenous protocols, not extracting from them
- **Nation-Building:** Platforms that serve Indigenous futures on Indigenous terms
- **Capital Realignment:** Redirecting investment toward Indigenous-led innovation

**Philosophy:**
Technology without wisdom is just destruction. At Indigenomics, we build tech that honors Indigenous wisdom, serves justice, and proves sovereignty and innovation aren't contradictory.

## 📸 Photography: Where It All Began

### Visual Storytelling Foundation

My journey started behind the camera—documenting the world for **National Geographic** and **Rolling Stone**, capturing tech pioneers (Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg) and cultural moments that defined eras.

**What Photography Taught Me:**
- How to see connections others miss
- How to find the human story in complex narratives
- How to bridge worlds that seem separate
- How to document what matters

That photographer's eye—the ability to frame complexity, capture the moment, reveal humanity—now informs everything I do in AI, community building, and Indigenous tech work.

**Select Portfolio Highlights:**
- National Geographic documentary projects
- Tech industry cultural documentation (SXSW, TED, Web Summit)
- Indigenous community storytelling
- Social movement documentation

Photography isn't my primary focus anymore. But it's the foundation that shapes how I approach technology, community, and justice.
